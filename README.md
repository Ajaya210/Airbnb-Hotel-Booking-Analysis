## Project Overview
The Airbnb Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project aims to understand the dynamics of Airbnb rentals by analyzing various factors such as pricing, availability, neighborhood groups, room types, and customer feedback. The project focuses on gaining insights into the travel industries and uncovering trends, patterns, user preferences, and behavior.

## Goals
- **Understand the factors that influence Airbnb prices** in a specific location, such as New York City.
- **Identify patterns of all variables** and provide useful information for travelers, hosts, and the Airbnb business.
- **Utilize Python libraries** for data exploration, data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.

## Process
### Data Collection
- Gathered Airbnb listings and reviews data.
- The dataset includes various aspects of the rental experience, such as pricing, availability, neighborhood groups, room types, and customer feedback.

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values, treated outliers, performed target encoding, and executed feature engineering.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized data using graphs and charts to uncover patterns and trends.

### Data Splitting
- Split the data into training and testing sets for model building.

### Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning
- Employed regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

### Evaluation Metrics
- Focused on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to evaluate the model.

## Details of the Features
- **Price**: The cost of the Airbnb rental.
- **Availability**: The number of days the rental is available.
- **Neighborhood Group**: The area where the rental is located.
- **Room Type**: The type of room (e.g., entire home, private room).
- **Customer Feedback**: Reviews and ratings from guests.

## Skills Used
- **Programming**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit Learn.
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest.
- **Data Analysis**: Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering.

## Problem Statement
The travel industry is highly competitive, and understanding the dynamics of Airbnb rentals is crucial for success. This project aims to analyze various factors that influence Airbnb prices and provide valuable insights for travelers, hosts, and the Airbnb business. By identifying patterns and trends, the project helps improve customer experience, optimize pricing strategies, and enhance overall business performance.
