==============================================

## Project Overview
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing 49,000 Airbnb listings in New York City. The analysis aims to identify key factors influencing pricing and availability and provide actionable insights for hosts and travelers.

## Tools & Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Google Colab

## Objectives
1. Identify key factors affecting Airbnb listing prices and availability.
2. Uncover neighborhood trends, host activity, and price variations.
3. Provide strategic recommendations for hosts and investment opportunities.

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
* Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and detected outliers to ensure accurate analysis.
* Cleaned and preprocessed data using Python and Pandas.

## Visual Insights
* Developed visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze neighborhood trends, host activity, and price variations.
